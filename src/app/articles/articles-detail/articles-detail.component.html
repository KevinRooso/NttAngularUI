                <p class="py-4">We are living in an era of instant consumption. From ordering food to booking cabs, almost every
                  service is available in the form of an app. Given the extreme pace that most businesses operate today,
                  every enterprise wants their IT infrastructure to operate at a pace that the business demands.
                  Enterprises need their IT infrastructure to scale quickly to match the pace of the business. This is
                  extremely challenging in the digital era, where business dynamics change quickly – consider a big
                  billion sale on an ecommerce website, where the demand on the ecommerce website outpaces the
                  infrastructure they have in place.</p>
